				This experiemnt generates images and mutates itself to optimize the best image it can generate.

			<h2>Technical</h2>
			<p>
				The image takes the original image and draws a bunch of shapes. Depending on where the image was places, the generator reads 
				the color of the position where the shape is placed, then it assigns that color to the shape. The generator takes three shapes 
				and includes an image of each planet in our solar system. The user has the ability to upload their own images and change the 
				mutation rate.

			<h2>Reflection</h2>
			<p>
				Overall, the experient was easier than expected. There were some hiccups along the way, such as 
				figuring out how mutation worked and how to implement colors. One of the biggest hurdles I faced was 
				figuring out how to implement an upload button so that users can upload their own images. 
				Also, there were some instances where the images werenâ€™t being loaded so it gave errors. 
				One thing that went successfully was eventually getting the upload button to work and having more.<br>
				* ChatGPT was a major help throughout this project.
