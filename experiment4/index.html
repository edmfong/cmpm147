				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiemnt displays procedural generation to create infinite worlds.<br>
					The theme of world 1 is a duck in the plains who can enjoy as much bread as it wants.<br>
					The theme of world 2 is a duck in space and it's goal is to explore the cosmos.<br>
					The theme of world 3 is a duck lost at sea, simulating Moby Duck.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Infinity</b><br>
					I used the infinite extent of my world to represent an ocean, space, and plains.<br><br>

					<b>Variation in Space</b><br>
					As the audience browses my world, theyâ€™ll see various garbage scattered around the ocean, 
					various planets as they explore space, and an infinite amount of bread scattered around in the plains<br><br>

					<b>Variations in Key</b><br>
					Different worlds will have different backgrounds, from the vast ocean, space, and plains.<br><br>

					<b>Signs of Life</b><br>
					Clicking adjacent tiles causes the player to move to clicked tile, or can use WASD to move.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Overall, the experiment was easier than expected. 
					There were some hiccups along the way, such as figuring out how to assign muiltiple values. 
					One of the biggest hurdles I faced was assigning multiple values to an object and figuring out how to center the player when it moved. 
					One thing that went successfully was loading my custom tilesheet I made myself using differnt sizes. <br>
					* ChatGPT was a major help throughout this project.
