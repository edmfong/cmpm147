				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p><b>Color</b><br> The sky, grass, trees, cloud, and ducks were estimated based on testing different colors on the color wheel tool via Google.<br><br>
					<b>Primitives</b><br> The trees are rendered with `triangle` primitives.<br>
								  The duck are rendered with various `triangle` and `ellipse` primatives.<br><br>
					<b>Polygons</b><br> The riverbank and grass land are two single randomly generated polygon using `vertex` calls.<br><br>
					<b>Composition</b><br> Different noise values lead to differently shaped river bank and grass land. The trees are positioned along the grass land vertexes.<br>
								   The trees sizes, cloud color, cloud speed, and duck speed are generated randomly.<br><br>
					<b>Life</b><br> The position of cloud and ducks are animated over time as if to simulate the view from ducks swimming and clouds moving.<br>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, the experiment was easier than expected. However, there were some hiccups along the way. One hiccup that took
					the longest to solve was why the trees kept "moving," but later I discovered that since the trees were 'drawn' every frame,
					the size was changing every frame. Other than that, the experiment was a success and the shapes turned out pretty good.<br>
					* ChatGPT was a major help throughout this project.
