				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiemnt displays procedural generation utilizing autotiling.<br>
					The theme of the overworld is a lone house in the woods next to a lake as the seasons change.<br>
					The theme of the dungeon is a typical RPG dungeon featuring randomly generated loot or mobs in each room.	
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					Overworld:<br>
					The world is procedurally generated utilizing noise to randomize the water, and land.<br>
					To make the world more random, the trees and lilypads are randomly placed based on noise.<br>
					Based on the theme, only one duck and house are randomly placed.
					<br><br>
					Dungeon:<br>
					The dungeon is procedurally generated utilizing noise and the dungeon size is randomized.<br>
					To make each dungeon room more random, the loot and mobs are randomly placed.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Overall, the experiment was harder than expected. There were some hiccups along the way,
					such as implementing the autotiling and messing with noise variables. One of the biggest
					hurdles I faced was generating and connecting hallways in the dungeons. One thing that went
					successfully was that changing the tiles based on the time worked well.
					* ChatGPT was a major help throughout this project.
